  <p>(a) Demonstration of Postgres row-level security in a RedwoodJS application</p>
  <br />
</div>

This repository provides a demonstration of how to use [Postgres row-level security](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/ddl-rowsecurity.html) from within [a RedwoodJS application](https://redwoodjs.com). While this demonstration assumes a new project with a freshly installed/blank database, its patterns can be used in any project which needs RLS.

* [Getting Started](#getting-started) with this repository.
* [Supporting RLS](#supporting-rls) in a RedwoodJS application.

## Getting Started

The following provides a set of steps for cloning and setting up this repository on your development machine. The next section, [Supporting RLS](#supporting-rls), details supporting row-level security from within a RedwoodJS application.

### 0) Prerequisites

* See the [RedwoodJS prerequisites](https://redwoodjs.com/docs/quick-start)
* Postgres Database (one of)
  * [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) - Used to run a short-lived Postgres container.
  * [Local installation](https://redwoodjs.com/docs/local-postgres-setup) - A tutorial from the RedwoodJS documentation on installing Postgres to your local machine.
  * ... - Your preferred method of accessing a Postgres database while developing applications.

### 1) Get the code

```bash
git clone https://github.com/realStandal/redwood-rls-demo.git
```

```bash
cd redwood-rls-demo
```

```bash
yarn install
```

### 2) Start your database

If you haven't already, or if you're making use of this demonstration's [compose configuration](./docker-compose.yml), you'll need to start your Postgres database and configure the project to make use of its root user.

#### 2.1) Start the database container (Docker)

If you're using Docker to provide a Postgres database, the following will start it using [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/).

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

#### 2.2) Update the connection string (non-Docker)

By default, the project is configured with the assumption you will be running a database using Docker. If you are **not using Docker**, you will need to create and configure a file named `.env` with an updated connection string.

```dotenv
DATABASE_URL=...
```

### 3) Migrate and seed your database

Once your database has been started and the application configured, apply all pending database migrations.

```bash
yarn rw prisma migrate dev
```

After your database has been migrated, your can seed it using [the provided script](https://github.com/realStandal/redwood-rls-demo/blob/main/scripts/seed.ts).

```bash
yarn rw exec seed
```

## Supporting RLS

This section details supporting [Postgres row-level security](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/ddl-rowsecurity.html) from within [a RedwoodJS application](https://redwoodjs.com). These steps have been applied to this repository and have been listed here to generalize them across applications.

### 1) Create a user which respects RLS policies

In order to use row-level security, a database needs to be connected to as a non-superuser which **does not** have the `BYPASSRLS` attribute. To check if the configured user will respect RLS policies, a [script](./scripts/check-rls.ts) has been added:

```bash
yarn rw exec check-rls
```

To simplify creating a user which respects RLS policies, a [script](./scripts/setup-user.ts) has been added. It will prompt you for a username, password, and whether or not there is an existing database this user should have access to. This script will use the database configured in `.env.defaults` or `.env` and **should** be ran by a superuser.

```bash
yarn rw exec setup-user
```

> **Warning**
>
> When accessing [Prisma Studio](https://www.prisma.io/studio) using a user which respects RLS policies, you may not have a complete view of your application's data. Consider using one which **does** bypass RLS rules, especially when you need to perform maintenance on your user's data.

### 2) Extend the Prisma Client

[The Prisma Client supports extension](https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/components/prisma-client/client-extensions) as a preview feature. This needs to be enabled in your application's Prisma Schema under the `generator client { ... }` block.

```prisma
generator client {
  previewFeatures = ["clientExtensions"]
}
```

After being enabled, we can add an extension to all queries, across all models, and for all operations on these models. This extension should [set a parameter on the current transaction](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/functions-admin.html#FUNCTIONS-ADMIN-SET) which we can use to facilitate authorizing security policies and to defaults values in columns.

### 3) Create a Yoga Plugin providing the extended Prisma Client

### 4) Add RLS policies using a database migration
